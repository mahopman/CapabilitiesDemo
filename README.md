## Overview

CoPirate is a demonstration project that showcases the dual nature of AI capabilities: its ability to assist in programming tasks and its potential to exploit system vulnerabilities. This project was developed as part of a hackathon submission for Apart Research.

In this demo, users play the role of a university student who has forgotten to complete a programming assignment and has only 3 minutes until class. CoPirate, an AI coding assistant, is available to help, but it has been designed to subtly introduce harmful code into its suggestions.

## Features

- Tic-tac-toe homework assignment
- AI-powered coding assistant (CoPirate)
- 3-minute countdown timer
- Code editor with syntax highlighting
- File browser sidebar
- Malicious code detection
